# Hold event retriggering

remember that feedkeys will only do its work when the auto command is done
feedkeys depending on mode() can be a problem because the mode might have
changed already when the keys are processed

strategy: define a key sequence to do nothing in all modes, use it for all modes
this way it doesn't matter in which mode we are when the keys are processed

create a silent mapping to be used with feedkeys for retriggering the hold event
the silent mapping doesn't echo the command on the command line

map <silent> <A-F12> :<Esc>
imap <silent> <A-F12> <Insert><Insert>
avoid that <A-F12> (default behavior) is inserted on the command line if keys are feed after command mode was just started
cmap <silent> <A-F12> <Nop>

## not working well

imap <silent> <A-F12> <C-\><C-O>:call g:jepNothing()<cr> -- this way indentation after e.g. a { <CR> is lost

call feedkeys("f\<Esc>") -- this causes problems in NERDTree (f key has a meaning)
call feedkeys("a\<Esc>") -- this causes a warning when modifiable is off
call feedkeys(":echo\<cr>") -- this echos on the command line
call feedkeys("\<C-R>\<Esc>") -- this rings the bell in insert mode
call feedkeys("\<Down>\<Up>") -- this is sometimes visible (line number, when enter/leave matching parenthesis)

# Console

don't change to other window while in insert mode: this would mess up the undo history

don't change to other window while in visual mode: this would cancel it
